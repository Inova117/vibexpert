## üéØ **STEP 2: AI ANALYSIS & STACK RECOMMENDATION**

### **Vibe-Builder's Intelligent Analysis**:

```typescript
const aiAnalysis = {
  detected_pattern: "Multi-tenant SaaS with marketplace features",
  complexity_score: 7.5, // out of 10
  key_challenges: [
    "Multi-user authentication (coaches + clients)",
    "Payment processing with revenue sharing", 
    "Content management and delivery",
    "Real-time scheduling and video calls",
    "Progress tracking and analytics"
  ],
  
  recommended_approach: "MVP-first with core features, scale incrementally"
}

const recommendedStack = {
  architecture: "Serverless Multi-tenant SaaS",
  
  frontend: {
    tech: "Next.js 14 + TypeScript",
    reasoning: "SEO crucial for coach discovery, great performance, easy deployment"
  },
  
  backend: {
    tech: "Supabase Edge Functions + PostgreSQL",
    reasoning: "Built-in auth, RLS for multi-tenancy, real-time features, global scale"
  },
  
  payments: {
    tech: "Stripe Connect",
    reasoning: "Handles marketplace payments, automatic revenue splitting, global support"
  },
  
  video_calls: {
    tech: "Daily.co API",
    reasoning: "Easy integration, reliable, supports recording, affordable"
  },
  
  file_storage: {
    tech: "Supabase Storage + Cloudflare",
    reasoning: "Integrated with auth, global CDN, optimized for video content"
  },
  
  hosting: {
    tech: "Vercel",
    reasoning: "Zero-config deployment, edge network, preview environments"
  }
}
```

### **Why We DIDN'T Choose Alternatives**:

```typescript
const alternativesRejected = {
  firebase: "Complex pricing for video storage, limited SQL capabilities",
  aws_direct: "Over-engineering for MVP, steep learning curve, high costs",
  wordpress: "Not suitable for complex SaaS features, security concerns",
  no_code_platforms: "Limited customization for marketplace features",
  custom_backend: "Too time-consuming for 2-3 month timeline"
}

## üîí **STEP 4: SECURITY-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Security Measures Built Into Every Step**:

```sql
-- Example: Multi-tenant RLS policies
CREATE POLICY "coaches_own_data" ON coach_profiles
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "clients_see_active_coaches" ON coach_profiles  
  FOR SELECT USING (is_active = true AND is_approved = true);

CREATE POLICY "clients_own_subscriptions" ON subscriptions
  FOR ALL USING (auth.uid() = client_id);

CREATE POLICY "coaches_see_their_subscribers" ON subscriptions
  FOR SELECT USING (
    coach_id IN (
      SELECT user_id FROM coach_profiles 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### **Security Checkpoints Throughout Development**:
